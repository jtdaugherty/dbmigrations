2.1.0
-----

Private Atlassian fork by hlevsen@atlassian.com for hackathon app:

- Replace outdated yaml-light dependency with yaml package

2.0.0
-----

This release contains breaking changes!

- Factored out all database-specific functionality into separate
packages (thanks Bastian Krol)
- Replaced "moo" program with one that emits an error instructing users
to use backend-specific dbmigrations packages
- Added missing test data files to package
- Removed `DBM_DATABASE_TYPE` environment variable in favor of backend
selection by use of backend-specific packages
- Allow `DBM_TIMESTAMP_FILENAMES` to be set via environment variable
(thanks Alexander Lippling)

1.1.1
-----

- Improve configuration validation error messages and clean up
validation routine
- Reinstate support for GHC 7.8

1.1
---

- Add support for MySQL databases (thanks Ollie Charles
<ollie@ocharles.org.uk>). Please see MOO.TXT for a disclaimer about this
feature!

1.0
---

- Added support for (optionally) adding timestamps to generated
migration filenames (thanks Matt Parsons <parsonsmatt@gmail.com>)
  * Adds flag for time stamp on file names
  * Adds configuration for timestamping filenames
- Added new "linear migrations" feature (thanks Jakub Fija≈Çkowski
<fiolek94@gmail.com>, Andrew Martin <amartin@layer3com.com>). This
feature is an optional alternative to the default behavior: rather than
prompting the user for dependencies of new migrations (the default
behavior), linear mode automatically selects dependencies for new
migrations such that they depend on the smallest subset of migrations
necessary to (effectively) depend on all existing migrations, thus
"linearizing" the migration sequence. See MOO.TXT for details.
- Configuration file loading now defaults to "moo.cfg" in the CWD if
--config-file is not specified, and environment variables override
settings in the config file

0.9.1
-----

- Restored default timestamp and description values in migrations
created by new migration command

0.9
---

- Fix 'moo' usage output to use correct program name
- Replaced Backend type class in favor of concrete Backend record type
- Added hdbcBackend constructor
- Backends now always run in IO rather than some MonadIO
- Removed monad parameter from MigrationStore (always use IO)
- Replaced MigrationStore type class with concrete MigrationStore type
- Added filesystem migration store constructor
- Improve configuration type so that it has been implicitly validated
- Made newMigration pure, made migration timestamps optional
- createNewMigration now takes a Migration for greater caller control
